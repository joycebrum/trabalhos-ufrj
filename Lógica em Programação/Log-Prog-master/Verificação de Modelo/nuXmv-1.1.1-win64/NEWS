********************** nuXmv 1.1.1 (2016-06-01) **********************

This is a minor release of nuXmv that provides mainly various bug fixes.

The list of minor improvements within this release are:

- Fixed some small bugs related to the Uninterpreted Function feature
  introduced in release 1.1.0.

- Fixed a corner case on the expansion of the bounded past operator H
  (historically).

- Removed some further ambiguities in the user manual, fixed some
  typos missed in previous release, and removed internal debug
  comments.

********************** nuXmv 1.1.0 (2016-05-10) **********************

This is a major release of nuXmv, containing new features, and bug
fixes. The documentation has been updated to cover the new features.

The list of new features within this release are:

* Extended the language to allow for the specification of
  Uninterpreted Functions, and extended the interfaces and all the SMT
  based algorithms to handle designs using Uninterpreted Functions.

* Added the possibility to specify bounded version of the LTL temporal
  operators F (eventually), G (globally), H (historically), and O (once).
  Example: "F [2, 4] phi" eventually from 2 to 4 steps phi holds.

* Integrated the low level model checking engines that participated to
  the HWMCC 2015 as replacement of the previous ones.

* Re-enabled commands for performing requirements analysis to check
  for consistency of a set of LTL formulas, for checking possibility
  and assertions in form of LTL formulas w.r.t. a set of LTL
  properties.

* Integrated all the new features and new commands released with
  release 2.6.0 of NuSMV.

Several bugs were fixed in this version (also those inherited from
NuSMV). Many thanks to those users who reported issues, and helped
improving nuXmv. Here the most critical bug fixes are listed:

- Fixed several corner cases in the SMT encoding introduced by some of
  the optimizations released in v1.0.1 that prevented the use of SMT
  based algorithms for the verification of designs with infinite
  domain variables or non-bit blasted bit-vectors.

- Integrated several bug-fixes from the development version of MathSAT5.

- Integrated all the bug-fixes from NuSMV 2.6.0 and from its
  development version.

- Revised the documentation to remove typos and ambiguities.

********************** nuXmv 1.0.1 (2014-11-17) **********************

This is a minor release of nuXmv that provides some internals
improvements and several bug fixes.

The list of minor improvements within this release are:

- Included the low level model checking engines that participated to
  the HWMCC 2014 as replacement of the previous ones.

- Improved the conversion into SMT by avoiding memory and computation
  blow up due to expensive internal transformations to enable for the
  booleanization of finite domain expressions.

- Avoided creation of BDD variables if not needed when verifying a
  design using SMT techniques that often resulted in very expensive
  computations.

- Integrated several optimizations and improvements from the
  development version of NuSMV.

- Improved error message in batch mode for designs with infinite
  domains variables. nuXmv now exits smoothly with an error message
  and suggestions on how to verify the design instead of reporting an
  internal error.

More that 30 bugs were fixed in this version. Many thanks to those
users who reported issues, and helped improving nuXmv. Here the most
critical bug fixes are listed:

- Fixed several corner cases in the SMT encoding that prevented the
  use of IC3-like algorithms for the verification of designs with
  infinite domain variables or non-bit blasted bit-vectors.

- Fixed a crash within the LTL bounded model checking via SMT
  reported anonymously by a nuXmv user.

- Avoided internal error for not supported operators for models with
  infinite domain variables, providing the user with more informative
  error messages.

- Fixed a bug in the translation from nuXmv to AIGER while encoding
  LTL properties and fairness constraints in the corresponding AIGER
  file.

- Fixed internal reconstruction of the counter example for k-live and
  IC3 based algorithms.

- Integrated several bug-fixes from the development version of NuSMV.
