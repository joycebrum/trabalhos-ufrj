# Juma R2RML

Juma, jigsaw puzzles for representing mapping, is a method that applies the block metaphor to mapping languages.

In this implementation, we have applied the Juma method to the W3C Recommendation [R2RML](https://www.w3.org/TR/r2rml/). 

The implementation described in [3] is available at [Juma Uplift](https://github.com/ademarcrotti/juma-uplift).
