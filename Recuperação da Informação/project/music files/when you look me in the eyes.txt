When You Look Me In The Eyes
Jonas Brothers
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
If the heart is always searching
Can you ever find a home?
I've been looking for that someone
I never make it on my own

Dreams can't take the place
Of loving you
There's gotta be a million reasons
Why it's true

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side

When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

How long will I be waiting
To be with you again?
I'm gonna tell you that I love you
In the best way that I can

I can't take a day
Without you here
You're the light that makes
My darkness disappear

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side

When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes

Move and more I start to realize
I can reach my tomorrow
I can hold my head up high
And it's all because you're by my side

When you look me in the eyes
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright
When you're right here by my side

When I hold you in my arms
I know that is forever
I just gotta let you know
And never wanna let you go

Cause when you look me in the eyes (because)
And tell me that you love me
Everything's alright (it's alright)
You're right here by my side (by my side)

When you look me in the eyes
I catch a glimpse of heaven (oh)
I find my paradise
When you look me in the eyes
Ohh, yeah! Ohh, whoa yeah!
