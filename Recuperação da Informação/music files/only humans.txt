Only Human
Jonas Brothers
Yeah
Ayy

I don't want this night to end
It’s closing time, so leave with me again (yeah)
You got all my love to spend, oh
Let's find a place where happiness begins

We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I’m leaving you (ayy)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk to an 80s groove (ayy)
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude, drunk

It's only human, you know that it's real
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
Oh, babe, you can't fool me
Your body's got other plans, so
Stop pretending you're shy
Just come on and dance, dance, dance, dance, oh

Early morning la-la-light
Only getting up to close the blinds, oh
I’m praying you don’t change your mind
'Cause leaving now just don’t feel right
Let's do it one more time, oh babe

We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (hurts when I’m leaving you)
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Drunk to an 80s groove (ayy)
We gon' dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Hurts when I'm leaving you (ayy)
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude, drunk

It's only human, you know that it's real (know that it's real)
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
(The way that you feel)
Oh, babe, you can't fool me
Your body's got other plans, so
Stop pretending you're shy
Just come on and dance, dance, dance, dance, oh

Dance, oh (woo, ayy)
Only human
It's only (-man), it's only (-man)
Only human
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Only human
It's only (-man), it's only (-man)
Only human
